# Task 2

## Retrieve desk data dynamically

- Initially added the script tag in the head of index.html
    - Event listeners didn't work because they were executed before the DOM loaded
- JavaScript loops
    - Some troubles with the differences between for, of and in when looping through arrays and objects
- Retrieving bookings
  - User Story 2 says "As an employee, I want to view the current bookings of the desks so I can find a free time slot for me."
    - Doesn't seem possible. You have to specify a student ID when requesting the current bookings of a desk, which means you would need a list of every single student ID to get all current bookings of a desk.
